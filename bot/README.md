**Want to learn Go?**

Study the sample Telegram bot program named [sample2.go](https://github.com/ibmendoza/go-examples/blob/master/bot/sample2.go). 
You can try it by downloading Telegram app on your desktop, tablet or smartphone.

On Telegram, search for **gowizard**, click on it, then click Start.

Just type **start** or **sample**

Tweet us your experience [@itmarketplc](https://twitter.com/itmarketplc).

Better yet, blog your experience while learning Go in the process.

Remember that this program is deliberately made simple but no simpler.

Feel free to improve it, tweak it, use a database for storage, whatever.

It's all up to you (aka fork this repo).

Have fun!
